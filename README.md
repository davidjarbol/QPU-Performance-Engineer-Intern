# QPU-Performance-Engineer-Intern
Report on my work during my 2-month internship in Pasqal, Paris, as a QPU Performance Engineer.

◦ Wrote a revision on the experimental setup that conforms a Quantum Processor Unit (QPU) based on neutral atoms of 87Rb.
◦ Revised the theory on Rabi Oscillations with two-photon transitions.
◦ Modelled and simulated the atom oscillations in an optical trap.
◦ Calibrated the laser pulses that induced the Rabi oscillations finding and characterising anomalies in the functioning.
◦ Prepared a detailed report and presented a poster showcasing the obtained results.
